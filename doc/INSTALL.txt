
Installation instructions
-------------------------

ANA-MP come with all the classes already compiled and a jar file
(bin/ana-mp-<version>.jar). Put this jar file anywhere you want and make sure
your CLASSPATH environment variable points to it.

In windows run:
    set CLASSPATH=c:\some\path\ana-mp-0.9.7.4.jar;%CLASSPATH%
In unix/linux run (assuming your're using bash):
    export CLASSPATH=some/path/ana-mp-0.9.7.4.jar:$CLASSPATH

Test that it is working by running:
    java -jar some\path\ana-mp-0.9.7.4.jar some\mod\file.mod
or
    java anakata.modplay.example.cli.Player some\mod\file.mod


Compiling the sources
---------------------

If you're considering compiling the sources, you probably already know how to
do it :-) Tip: There is a build.xml file for you if you have ant installed.
