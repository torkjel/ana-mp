0.9.7.3 -> 0.9.7.4
------------------

 - separated the example command line player from the player API. A fairly
   complete and usable player API can now be found in
   anakata.modplay.Player, with an asynchrounus version in
   anakata.modplay.ThreadedPlayer.
 - the standard example command-line player has been moved to
   anakata.modplay.example.cli.Player.
 - fixed the "noint" (no interpolation) command line option for the
   standard command line player.
 - added several simple examples:
   o anakata.modplay.example.cli.SimplePlayer: very simple and well
     documented example player. This is probably the first place you want
     to look if you want to create your own player.
   o anakata.modplay.example.cli.SimpleThreadedPlayer: same as above, but
     using the asynchrounus version of the player API.
   o anakata.modplay.example.applet.AppletPlayer: An example of playing
     modules from an applet.
   o anakata.modplay.example.applet.ThreadedAppletPlayer: same as above but
     using the asynchrounus player API.
 - various javadoc improvements

0.9.7.2 -> 0.9.7.3
------------------

- added (fake) ascii scopes and better looking command-line output
- added ability to load an applet from an url, making it possible to use it
  in an applet
- quite a few stability fixes.
- some S3M fixes. it's still not particularly good though...
- fixes bad key-off handling in XMs
- fixed a off-by-one error causing the wrong sample to be played in
  multi-sample XM instruments.
- clip, don't overflow, when amplification is turned up to much
- there is some experimental GUI code in cvs too... check out the V_0_9_7_3
  tag if you're adventurous.

0.9.7.1 -> 0.9.7.2
---------------

- Don't crash if effects are applied to an undefined instrument

0.9.7.0 -> 0.9.7.1
---------------

- Support XMs with more than one sample per instrument
- Don't crash if an undefined instrument is played
- Fixed a nasty mixer bug. The left and right channel was out
  of sync...

0.96 -> 0.9.7.0
---------------

Added S3M support! :) It's still experimental though.

Changed version numbering scheme: major.minor.micro.nano

0.95 -> 0.96
------------

Made interpolated mixing work. Mixing is now handled by plugins and mixers
with higer order interpolation should be easy to implement. The command line
option "noint" can be used if you want to use a faster (crappier)
interpolation algorithm.

Reworked the output plugin interface. The player now always work at 44100Hz,
16 bits, stereo. It's up to the output plugin to resample if a lower quality
is needed. This simplifies the player code but means that there is no
performance gain in decreasing the sound quality.

Wav output plugin added. Supports only 44100Hz, 16 bits stereo. Use the
"wav" command line option.

Version number increased :-)

Bugfix: KeyOff resulted in sample being cut.

Reorganized the distribution:
 -All files distributed in one archive.
 -Added build.xml for building using ant.
 -Added this file :-)

Lots of smaller code cleanups.
